# 📧 Email Spam Classifier

## 📝 Project Overview

The **Email Spam Classifier** project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). By analyzing the text content of emails, the model can predict whether an email is likely to be spam, helping users filter out unwanted or potentially harmful emails.

## ✨ Features

- **🔍 Text Preprocessing**: The email text is preprocessed using techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
- **📊 Feature Extraction**: Various features are extracted from the text, including word frequency, TF-IDF, and other relevant text features.
- **🤖 Model Training**: A machine learning model is trained using a labeled dataset of emails, with different algorithms tested and compared for optimal performance.
- **📈 Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure it meets the required performance criteria.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-spam-classifier.git
   cd email-spam-classifier
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Scripts**:
- *Preprocess the data*:
    ```bash
    python src/data_preprocessing.py
- *Extract features*:
    ```bash
    python src/feature_extraction.py
- *Train the model*:
    ```bash
    python src/model_training.py
- *Evaluate the model*:
    ```bash
    python src/model_evaluation.py
4. **Make Predictions**:
    ```bash
    python src/predict.py --email "Your email text here"
## 📊 Results

The model achieved an accuracy of **X%**, with a precision of **Y%** and recall of **Z%** on the test dataset. The confusion matrix and other evaluation metrics can be found in the `model_evaluation.py` script or the corresponding Jupyter notebook.

## 🔮 Future Work

- Improve feature extraction by incorporating more advanced NLP techniques.
- Experiment with different machine learning models and ensemble methods.
- Integrate the model into an email client for real-time spam detection.
